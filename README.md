# Welcome to my blog!

or should I say, its source code. This repository really is just for saving the countless files of the blog.

I want to say first and foremost that _I am building this blog with no previous template_, making all the HTML code from scratch. If the site looks a bit uninspired and cheap don't worry I'm working on it.

Currently, my only active socials are Instagram and Discord, which can be found here:
